Course Syllabus

Course Description.  This course is an introduction to computer programming for those who have never programmed.
We will first study the context in which to produce programs. Then we will study the nature of computer systems. 
We will then learn to use various design tools to which aid in the creation of programs. We will also explore
some of the basics of a programming language.
Course Objectives:
1.	Understand different problem solving steps used to solve a computer problem
2.	Know how to solve computer problems that involve decisions, loops, sequential logic, and case logic
3.	Be able to write methods and understand the usefulness of object oriented programming
4.	Be able to write algorithms/pseudo code for various problems
5.	Understand data structures such as arrays and the different sorting techniques
6.	Be familiar with Python, Java, C#, and C++ programming languages so that you can fairly choose a 
    language to advance to, if desired.

Materials Needed.  Students will need a notebook and pens/pencils.  Students are to come prepared to class, 
bringing with them the appropriate materials used in class.  Should a student come to class without appropriate materials, 
participation points will be lost for the day.

Attendance and Participation.  Students are expected to attend class on a daily basis.  In the instance when an absence 
is unavoidable, it is the student’s responsibility to come in on the off day to obtain the homework assignment and make 
up any work missed.   If you choose not to do so, any assigned work that is graded the next day that the student doesn’t 
have will be considered late and you will receive a zero.  If you miss the day of a test, it is your responsibility to make
it up before the next class period.
